### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mian Maaz Ullah Khan, an experienced developer who has traversed the roles of a junior machine learning engineer and now a fullstack developer. My journey in technology has been marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a passion for innovation.

In the realm of AI and Web3, I am a staunch advocate for decentralization and transparency. These principles not only guide my work but also reflect my vision for the future of digital applications.

My commitment to the craft is exemplified by my goal of creating next-generation applications that seamlessly integrate generative AI and Web3 technologies. I am driven by the belief that these synergies hold immense potential to address the evolving challenges of our modern world.

My journey as a developer is defined by the quest to push boundaries, explore uncharted territories, and bring groundbreaking ideas to life. I look forward to the exciting possibilities that lie ahead as I continue to shape the future of technology through my work.

I specialise in Nextjs 13, TypeScript and TailwindCSS for fullstack development. However, I am eager to learn and adapt new technologies when required. I uses relevant technologies like Redux, PostgresSQL, Figma, AI, ML, AWS and much more.
